## 🚀 Quick Setup

### Prerequisites
- PHP 8.0 or higher
- SQLite support (usually included with PHP)
- Web server or PHP built-in server

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone or Download the Project**
   ```bash
   # If using git
   git clone <repository-url> choose-your-path
   cd choose-your-path

   # Or download and extract the ZIP file
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies** (for testing and development)
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Initialize the Database**
   ```bash
   php setup.php
   ```
   This creates the SQLite database at `data/game.db` with all required tables.

4. **Start the Development Server**
   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000 -t public/
   ```

5. **Open Your Browser**
   Navigate to: `http://localhost:8000`

### Testing the Application

Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
# Run all tests
./vendor/bin/phpunit

# Run with detailed output
./vendor/bin/phpunit --testdox

# Run specific test suites
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/        # Unit tests
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Integration/ # Integration tests
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Feature/     # Feature tests
```

### Alternative Setup (Production)

For production deployment:

1. Upload files to your web server
2. Run `php setup.php` once to initialize the database
3. Ensure the `data/` directory is writable by the web server
4. Point your domain to the `public/` directory

## 🎯 How to Play

1. **Create an Account**: Register with a username and password
2. **Start Your Adventure**: Choose to begin a new game or continue an existing one
3. **Make Choices**: Read the story text and select from available options
4. **Manage Resources**: Keep track of your health points and inventory items
5. **Reach an Ending**: Navigate through the story to achieve victory, defeat, or other outcomes
6. **Compete**: View the leaderboard to see how you compare with other players

## 🎨 Game Mechanics

### Health System
- Start with 100 HP
- Choices can increase or decrease health
- Game ends if health reaches 0
- Health affects final ranking

### Inventory System
- Collect special items through story choices
- Items are remembered throughout your journey
- Some items may influence available choices

### Save System
- Game automatically saves after each choice
- Continue from where you left off
- Option to start fresh at any time

### Scoring
- Final HP determines primary ranking
- Playtime affects tiebreakers (faster is better)
- Number of choices made provides additional scoring

## 🧪 Testing

Run the included test suite:

```bash
php tests/GameEngineTest.php
```

The test suite validates:
- Scene loading functionality
- Game state management
- HP boundary checking
- Error handling

## 🔧 Development

### Adding New Scenes

1. Create a new PHP file in the `scenes/` directory
2. Follow the existing scene structure:

```php
<?php
return [
    'title' => 'Scene Title',
    'text' => 'Narrative text describing the scene...',
    'image_alt' => 'Alt text for accessibility',
    'choices' => [
        'choice_key' => [
            'text' => 'Choice description',
            'next_scene' => 'target_scene',
            'hp_change' => 10,  // Optional
            'add_item' => 'Item Name'  // Optional
        ]
    ]
];
?>
```

### Customizing Styles

Edit `public/css/style.css` to modify:
- Color schemes
- Typography
- Animations
- Layout adjustments

### Database Modifications

To add new tables or modify existing ones:
1. Update `setup.php` with your changes
2. Delete `data/game.db` 
3. Run `php setup.php` again

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Password Hashing**: Uses PHP's `password_hash()` and `password_verify()`
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Prepared statements throughout
- **XSS Protection**: All output properly escaped with `htmlspecialchars()`
- **Session Security**: Secure session handling and CSRF protection
- **Remember Me Tokens**: Cryptographically secure token generation

## 📱 Browser Compatibility
